# How to make changes

To ensure eveything is ran by me (Zeekz, CEO) you are required to make a **PULL REQUEST** before making any changes, you can find out how to do that [here](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github). 

I ask that everyone, no mater your postion; CEO, COO to follow this protocal if I or anyone has asked you to change or add something to this page. 

Using this syestem allows senior developers. and the CTO to read over and make sure that the code is correct, formated and works. Serious punishments are handed out to people making silly pull requests and commits, doing so could result in removal from the brand and or business branches
